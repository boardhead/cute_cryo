<h2>CUTE Cryostat Position Control Help</h2>

<p>The CUTE cryostat is mounted on a set of 3 dampers to isolate it from
external sources of vibration.  This position system monitors and controls
the positions of these dampers to keep the cryostat in a fixed location.</p>

<p>This documentation explains the elements of the html interface to this
system.</p>

<h3>Motor speeds</h3>

<p>These indicate the speed in steps/sec and direction of each of the 3 control motors.
Positive motor speed drives the damper upwards.</p>

<h3>Active Control</h3>

<p>Enable or disable the active position control.  When activated, the control
system will attempt to keep all dampers at a position of 1.0 &plusmn; 0.1 mm.</p>

<h3>Air Pressure</h3>

<p>Measured ambient air pressure in the mine.  This value is used in the
calculation for the amount of weights to add.</p>

<h3>Damper positions</h3>

<p>Position in mm of the three dampers.  The target position is 1.0 &plusmn; 0.1 mm.</p>

<h3>Add weights</h3>

<p>These indicators are used when adding weights to balance the cryostat.  When
the system is active and under vacuum, weights should be added (+ve values) or
removed (-ve values) from each damper until these indicators are centered.</p>

<h3>Damper position history</h3>

<p>This is a 10-minute history of the three damper positions.  The most current
reading is at the left edge of this plot, and the points slide to the right
as time advances.</p>

<h3>Comment</h3>

<p>Type a comment in this field then press RETURN to enter the comment
in the log.  This may be used as a simple chat feature to communicate
with other clients connected to the position control system.</p>

<p>The up/down arrows on the keyboard may be used to recall previous
comments.</p>

<p>The comment field supports a set of commands beginning with a "/":</p>

<blockquote><table>
<tr><td valign='top'>/active&nbsp;[on|off|start]</td><td>Enable/disable active control. 
"start" starts motor even if damper is within tolerance.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign='top'>/avr#&nbsp;CMD</td><td>Send AVR command (# = AVR number).  eg. "/avr0 help".</td></tr>
<tr><td valign='top'>/cal</td><td>Show raw and calibrated readings from ADAM-6017 ADC.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign='top'>/help</td><td>Show this list of commands.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign='top'>/list</td><td>List connected AVR's.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign='top'>/log&nbsp;MSG</td><td>Enter a log message.  This is the same as entering a
comment in the log except that the message is not quoted.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign='top'>/name&nbsp;[WHO]</td><td>Get/set client name.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign='top'>/verbose&nbsp;[on|off]</td><td>Get/set verbose state.  Raw Adam readings
are logged once per second while verbose.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign='top'>/who</td><td>List connected clients.</td></tr>
</table></blockquote>

<p>Pressing ESC in this field stops all motors when active control is off.</p>
